Situation
A regional outage has affected services hosted in us-central1, causing downtime for applications relying on Cloud SQL databases, Cloud Storage buckets, and messaging through Pub/Sub.

Task
The goal is to ensure minimal disruption by implementing failover mechanisms, maintaining data integrity, and alerting stakeholders. The recovery plan should automate the process to minimize manual intervention.

Action
Database Failover – Cloud SQL Replicas

Use Cloud SQL cross-region replicas to maintain database availability.

When us-central1 fails, promote a read replica in another region, ensuring seamless transition.

If needed, direct traffic via Cloud Load Balancer to applications in another region.

Storage Continuity – Multi-Region Cloud Storage

Use multi-region Cloud Storage buckets to ensure high availability.

Applications should access NAM4 multi-region storage, automatically serving data from other locations.

Messaging & Alerts – Pub/Sub

Set up Pub/Sub topic replication to another region.

Use Cloud Monitoring and Alerting with Pub/Sub notifications to detect outages and trigger recovery actions.

Configure Cloud Functions to automatically reroute traffic or restart services.

Result
Applications remain operational with minimal downtime.

Data is accessible from another region without loss.

Teams receive instant notifications, allowing them to take corrective action quickly.

This approach ensures resilience, automation, and rapid recovery, keeping services available despite outages. Would you like additional details on the failover configurations?
